# Tokenized Transportation Infrastructure Management System

A blockchain-based system for managing transportation infrastructure assets using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing transportation infrastructure assets throughout their lifecycle. It enables asset registration, condition monitoring, maintenance scheduling, work order tracking, and performance analytics.

## Smart Contracts

### Asset Registration Contract

The Asset Registration Contract allows infrastructure owners to register and manage their assets on the blockchain. Each asset is assigned a unique identifier and includes details such as:

- Asset name
- Asset type (bridge, road, tunnel, etc.)
- Location
- Installation date
- Owner information

```clarity
;; Register a new asset
(define-public (register-asset 
                (name (string-utf8 100)) 
                (asset-type (string-utf8 50)) 
                (location (string-utf8 100)) 
                (installation-date uint))
  ;; Implementation details...
)
